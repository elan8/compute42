# Projects & Packages

## Project Management

Compute42 automatically detects Julia projects and manages environments for you.

## Working with Projects

- **Project Detection:** The IDE automatically detects Julia projects (Project.toml files)
- **Environment Activation:** Julia environments are activated automatically when opening projects
- **Project Structure:** Use the File Explorer to navigate your project structure
- **Project Settings:** Project-specific settings are maintained automatically

## Package Management

The terminal in Compute42 is not the same as the Julia REPL. It doesn't contain the package management features that the REPL has(by pressing ]). Instead use the build-in Package Management tool (on the bottom , below the file explorer)

- **Package Operations:** Use the Package Manager panel to install, update, and remove packages
- **Dependency Management:** Automatic dependency resolution and management
- **Package Search:** Search for packages directly in the Package Manager
- **Version Control:** Track package versions and updates
